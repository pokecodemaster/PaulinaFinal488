        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            I completed a Certificate in Web Programming from Montgomery College in 2015. This May I will graduate with a B.S. in Digital Media and Web Technology.<br><br>
            Check out my latest front-end development projects!

        <h2>HTML5 & CSS3</h2>
        <div class="name">
            <a href="discoverMexicoCity/index.html" target=_blank>Discover Mexico City</a>
        </div><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Class: Web Development</li>
            <li>
                This was the first project I created. It was for a class at Montgomery College in 2013.
                I chose this topic because I love Mexico City. The website helps people who are interested in
                visiting Mexico City find information about it. It focuses on the main attractions, where they are located,
                what time they are open and how much they cost.  
            </li>
        </ul><br>


        <div class="name">
            <a href="webProject/index.html" target=_blank>A.V.Impact</a>
        </div><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Class: Principles of Web Development I</li>
            <li>
                I created this project at UMUC in 2016. I currently work in IT and some of my
                responsibilities are as an Audiovisual Support Technician. This website showcases my
                skills and abilities in the field. It has original pictures taken by me and the content is also created by me
                based on what I do. 
            </li>
        </ul>
</div>

    <div class="wrap3">
        <div class="name">
            <a href="finalweb/index.html" target=_blank>A.V. Impact II</a>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Class: Principles of Web Development II</li>
            <li>I created this website at UMUC in 2016. This project is about a company that offers services to companies that buy their products.
            In this case, the University of Maryland is a customer that bought A.V. equipment and has been 
            installed in the Smith School of Business. Faculty and staff can contact TechSavvy for training,
            feedback or question purposes. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <div class="name">
            <a href="instaficient/index.html" target=_blank>InstaFicient</a>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Class: Principles of JavaScript</li>
            <li>I created this website at UMUC in 2016. The project is for people who are looking for other people who can offer services. If someone
            is looking for a Spanish tutor, they can visit this website and find someone who is offering their Spanish skills. Also, people can also post
            their abilities and skills to find jobs. Users can create an account to either find people or post skills. </li>
        </ul>
