<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>Smith IT staff are trained to provide only immediate technical support. If you want face-to-face training
with a professional technician from A.V.Impact, please request so at least 7 days before the start of a semester. A staff member from A.V.Impact
will be happy to help you.<strong> Note: You must be either a student, faculty or staff from the Smith School of Business to request
technical assistance.</strong></p><br>

<p id="answer8"><strong>Q. How often is the A.V. system checked for good performance?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>Our programmers make sure everyday that there are no flaws in the performance of the A.V. system. 
A technician from A.V.Impact personally checks the A.V. system in every classroom and conference room once
a week. Either way, if there is something that is not working properly, it is reported and fixed as soon as possible.</p>
