<h2>Zócalo</h2>
<p>The <i>Zócalo</i> is one of the largest public plazas in the world. It is located in the heart of the historic center of Mexico City and is one of the city's most famous attractions. The plaza used to be known simply as the "Main
Square" or "Arms Square," and today its formal name is Constitution
Square or <i>Plaza de la Constitución</i> in Spanish.</p>
<p>The modern square is bordered by the Cathedral, the National Palace, the Federal District,
the Old Portal de Mercaderes, the <i>Nacional Monte de Piedad</i> and the
<i>Templo Mayor</i>. In the center is a flagpole with an enormous Mexican
flag ceremoniously raised and lowered each day and carried into the
National Palace.
The word 'zócalo' means 'pedestal' and usage dates back to a planned
monument that was never completed beyond the pedestal. Nevertheless,
the word was used not only to describe Mexico City's square but most
squares throughout the country.</p>

<p>The <i>Zócalo</i> is used for government and political rallies, protest marches, sit-ins, concerts and other festive events that take place throughout the year. Every day at either 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. the Army has the ceremony of the raising and lowering of the Mexican flag in the center of the square.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, since 1982, due to efforts to revitalize the city center, the <i>Zócalo</i> has become the scene of a number of artistic and cultural events. There are daily impromptu shows of Aztec dancers dancing to drums, wearing feathered headdresses and anklets made of concha shells. On a grander scale, some examples of events held here recently are Spencer Tunick's photo shoot where nearly 18,000 Mexicans bared all for the artist, surpassing the record set earlier in Barcelona and the Ashes and Snow nomadic museum. One curious event was the building of a temporary ice-skating rink of about 3,200 m² in the middle of the <i>Zócalo</i>, for use by the city's residents for free in the winter of 2007.</p>
<p>The <i>Festival de México</i> is an annual event with programs dedicated to art (popular and fine) and academia held in the <i>Zócalo</i> and some other venues in the historic center.</p>
 
<p>And concerts by popular singers and groups have also been held here. For example, Colombian superstar Shakira drew a crowd of about 210,000 according to Mexico's Civil Protection.[25] In August 2008, a skateboarding/BMX event drew 50,000 young people on a Sunday afternoon. Paul McCartney gave a free concert here on May 10, 2012 in front of 200,000 people as a part of his On The Run Tour. Justin Bieber gave a free show here on July 11, 2012 in front of 250,000 people as a promotion for his new album Believe.</p>
