<p>The <i>Torre Latinoamericana</i>, also known as <i>Torre Latino</i>, is an amazing building that has a special place among the inhabitants as it is the classic skyscraper of the city. It is 597 ft tall and history makes it one of the city's most important landmarks. It is also widely recognized internationally as an engineering and architectural landmark since it was the world's first major skyscraper successfully built on highly active seismic land.</p>
<p>The name of the building has its origin in the name of an insuring company, La Latinoamericana Seguros. They both own and continue to work in the tower. It was inaugurated on 13th April 1956. At the time of completion, this was the tallest building in Latin America. <i>Torre Latinoamericana</i> is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. </p>
<p>The <i>Torre Latino</i> features its visitors a unique experience in <i>El Mirador</i>. Since more than fifty years, a unique observation roof takes advantage of an equally privileged location in the heart of downtown Mexico City, one that allows both a close view of the heart of the town and a breathtaking view of the Mexican Valley.</p>
<p>The mission of <i>El Mirador</i> is to offer its visitors a unique experience in the heart of Mexico City, with innovative, multiple and top quality entertainment attractions.</p>
<p>The outstanding building features 6 floors packed with attractions and viewpoints and it is conveniently open 365 days a year. Visitors can buy a bracelet that allows them to go up and down the skycraper as many times as they wish a day.</p>
