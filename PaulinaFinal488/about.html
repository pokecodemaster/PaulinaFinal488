<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>
I was born in Texas but lived in Mexico City many years. I finished up middle school and then moved to Brownsville, TX. I finished up high school in three years only and then pursued a B.A. in Communication Drama in Theater, TV and Film at UTPA.<br><br>
After graduating, I worked at KVEO News Center 23 where I handled different job positions: Master Control Operator, Studio Camera Operator, Audio Operator and Promotions Assistant.<br><br> 

Then, I decided to move to San Antonio to pursue an M.A. in Spanish at UTSA. While continuing my education, I was working for Sinclair Broadcast Group where I was a Master Control Operator for
KABB FOX San Antonio and KMYS TheCW.<br><br>

After completing the master's degree, I decided to move to the Washington D.C. area. I landed a job at CBS Radio where I was a Web Content Editor, Radio Broadcaster, M.C. (Master of Ceremonies), Translator, and Production and Promotions Assistant.<br><br> I also taught Spanish at Johns Hopkins University and 
Trinity Washington University.  I currently work at the University of Maryland and have over 4 years of experience in the audiovisual technology field. 
<br><br>Furthermore, I am about to graduate with a B.S. in Digital Media and Web Technology from UMUC. I would like to pursue a career in web development and also be able to apply all the skills I have learned in the last 
9 years.
