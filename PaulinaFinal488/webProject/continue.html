<h2>Personal Devices</h2>
	<p>Duplicate mode means that the image on my computer is going to be the exact same on the screen. 
	Extended mode means that I can have an image on my computer and different one on the screen. 
	This works when working on two different things at the same time.</p> 

<p>
	This works the same with a Mac computer. The only thing that varies is the use of a Mac adapter. Mac computers do not have VGA input. 
	A Mac adapter is connected directly to the computer and the VGA directly to the adapter. 
	If the connection is not automatic, it is just a matter of going to Settings, Display and select Mirror.</p>

<p> Some VGA cables come with an audio cable attached. If audio is going to be needed, the audio cable goes directly to the audio port in the laptop computer. 
If the VGA does not have one attached, an external audio cable would be needed, otherwise, if a video is going to be played, it would not be heard. </p>
<p>
HDMI cables work the same way but provide a much better quality to the image on screen. They are connected directly to the HDMI port in the laptop computer, 
and it does not need an audio cable. Once the HDMI cable is connected, both video and audio work. </p>

<p>If the case is that the laptop does not have either the VGA or HDMI port, miniHDMI plays a role here. It is connected directly to the laptop and the other end to the A.V. system. 
And voila! Beautiful image on screen.</p>
