<p>Mexico City, also known as Ciudad de Mexico, is the capital of Mexico. The city is full of glamour, cultural heritage and contemporary development.
The city was originally built on the Lake of Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325, and gave the name of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish took over the city in 1521 making what is known as the Conquest of Mexico.
